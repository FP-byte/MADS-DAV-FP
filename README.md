# Run the visualisations

Download a chat from Whatsapp and put it in the `data/processed` folder. Rename the file to `chat.txt' and run the following command:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

This will activate your virtual environment.
You can check which python is being used by running:
```bash
which python
```

After this, you can run the visualization with the following command, indicating the week number for the visualisation you want to see (number 1-7):

```bash
visualizer --week <nr>
```

```bash
visualizer all # to run all the visualizations
```
